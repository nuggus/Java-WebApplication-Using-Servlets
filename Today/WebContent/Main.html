										<strong>Employment is essential for lasting economic
											and social empowerment.</strong> <br> Unfortunately the
										employment for non vocational under-graduate students can
										become an insurmountable barrier even if they had academically
										performed better. <br> <br> • There is a deep
										reduction in number of undergraduates who get employment
										immediately after the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graduation.<br>
										<br> • Families from poor backgrounds lack advance
										financial planning and savings which puts such expenses
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond their means for self employment.<br>
										<br> • Loans are not easily available for self employment
										for non vocational graduates.<br> <br> <br> To
										address the above mentioned problem, National Self Employment
										Program for Undergraduate Students (NSEP) has come up with a
										unique solution that will encourage the family and student to
										fund as much as they can and NSEP program to contribute the
										balance based on the predefined condition/rule.
